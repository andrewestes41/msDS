# 1
## In R, create a numeric vector containing these percentages, and then use the barplot command to create
## a graph of the distribution of “number correct.” Make sure the graph axes are labeled correctly, and
## add an explanatory title.
```{r}
number_correct <- c(.14, .25, .24, .17, .1, .06, .03, .01, 0, 0, 0, 0)
answers <- c(1:12)
number_correct <- number_correct * 100

barplot(number_correct ~ answers,
        horiz = FALSE, 
        main = "Analysis of Answers", 
        ylab = "Percentage Correct",
        xlab = "Number of Questions ")
```


# 2
## Describe the shape of the graph you obtained

The graph above is heavily skewed to the right, meaning correct answers are hard to come by.
It is so hard in fact that nearly 75% of all correct answers only answered 1/3rd of the answers correctly.
